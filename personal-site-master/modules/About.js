          Hi, my name is Kamille. Much like this humble website, I am a work in progress. My interests span from <a href="/education/cal">ancient Rome</a> to <a href="/projects/DIHTFAPSL">the externalities of the price of milk</a>. Having had a penchant for languages since I was a child and won any spelling bee thrown at me, though high school and college when I dabbled variously in Spanish, German, French, Danish, Latin, and Italian, I now find myself immersed in technical languages that allow me to bring these language skills (and others) to life in so many new ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned almost all of my languages through hard work in every single level of the world-renowned California public school system (from K to B.A.), and through extensive travel (which I count among my passions). After graduating in Latin in 2015 and studying it on fellowship in Rome with <a href="http://www.paideiainstitute.org">the Paideia Institute</a>, I found myself inexplicably losing simple vocabulary. Noticing these memory issues and advocating hard for myself with doctors, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, for which surgery has only garnered a partial response. This setback forced me to put my career plans on hold in 2016, but rather than see it as a setback I recognize that it has increased my capacity for handling large situations in stride.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently working full-time as a web developer with the Cardiovascular Medicine team at the <a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-clinics/center-marfan-syndrome-related-aortic-disorders.html">Center for Marfan Syndrome and Related Aortic Disorders at Stanford University</a> where I am building <i>ab initio</i> a clinical and research web application for collecting and analyzing health data related to Marfan Syndrome. It will be put into production this summer for use at the <a href="https://www.marfan.org/resources/patients/conference">33rd Annual</a> National Marfan Foundation conference, and for consideration by the American Heart Association.

          I enjoy volunteering as a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-SF/members/183648109/">co-organizer</a> for the Ruby community of Women Who Code San Francisco. I give lightning talks to Ruby groups in San Francisco, most recently about Ruby Version Management. I will also be attending <a href="http://connect2017.womenwhocode.com/">CONNECT</a> and <a href="https://collisionconf.com/">Collision</a> later in 2017, as well as the annual Society for Classical Studies North America <a href="https://classicalstudies.org/annual-meeting/2018-annual-meeting">meeting</a> in January 2018 where I will be debuting <a href="http://classics.delgardo.co">the application</a> I made for The Paideia Institute and <a href="https://eidolon.pub">Eidolon</a>
        </p>

          I am a supporting member of the <a href="https://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://www.famsf.org">Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco</a>.
